// You're manually dispatching an RTK Query loadUser endpoint call using Redux Toolkitâ€™s store.dispatch. This is often used when you want to:

// Bypass React hooks (e.g., useLoadUserQuery) and use the store directly
// Trigger API calls globally, not tied to a component

// loadUser is defined in authApi slice

// ðŸ”¹ Manual Store Rehydration or
// ðŸ”¹ App Initialization with Preloading
// ðŸ”¹ Preloading Redux State on App Start

// appStore.dispatch(...): You are manually dispatching an action to the Redux store.
// authApi.endpoints.loadUser.initiate(...): This manually calls the RTK Query endpoint loadUser, as defined in your authApi slice.
// {}: This would be the payload/body/params if loadUser accepts any. Here, it's empty.
// { forceRefetch: true }: Forces the query to bypass cache and make a fresh request to the server, even if the data is already in the store.
